Have 3 terminals open:

One to run "mongodb", this is our database

Another to run our backend in "~/csc307/csc-307/app/packages/express-backend" using "node backend.js"

Third to run our frontend in "~/csc307/csc-307/app/packages/react-frontend" using "npm start"

Fourth is optional, but it is to use mongo commands in "mongosh", to double-check our backend is being updated with the frontend

Next, open the link at http://localhost:5173/, then see all data pass

mongosh commands here:
